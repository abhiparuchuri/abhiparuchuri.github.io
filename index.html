   <par> Ritvik has yet to decide exactly which field he wishes to pursue. Being in high school, 
     he wants to expose himself to as many different career paths as he can before he makes a concrete decision. 
     However, he does have some idea of what he wants to do. He has a desire to do something out of the ordinary. 
     He has interests in numerous fields, ranging from Bioengineering to Gaming. He wants to continue to use his 
     Engineering skill and apply them to a newer field. </par>
